# What Are Text Generation Models?

Text generation models utilize advanced algorithms to understand the meaning in text and produce outputs that are often indistinguishable from human work. If you’ve ever interacted with ChatGPT or marveled at its ability to craft coherent and contextually relevant sentences, you’ve witnessed the power of an LLM in action.

In natural language processing (NLP) and LLMs, the fundamental linguistic unit is a token. Tokens can represent sentences, words, or even subwords such as a set of characters. A useful way to understand the size of text data is by looking at the number of tokens it comprises; for instance, a text of 100 tokens roughly equates to about 75 words. This comparison can be essential for managing the processing limits of LLMs as different models may have varying token capacities.


## Five Principles of Prompting

1. **Give Direction**: Each prompt includes a clear direction on what type of product names to brainstorm.
    **Example Input:**
    ```
    Product description: A car that runs on solar energy
    Product names: [list of 3 product names]
    ```

2. **Specify Format**: Examples are provided in a specific format to ensure consistency and clarity.
    **Example Format:**
    ```
    [
    {
    "Product description": "A car that runs on solar energy.",
    "Product names": ["SunRide", "SolarDrive", "EcoSun"]
    }
    ]
    ```

3. **Provide Examples**: Examples of product descriptions and corresponding names are included to inspire creativity.
    **Example Prompt:**
   ```
    Product description: A car that runs on solar energy
    Product names: SunRide, SolarDrive, EcoSun
   ```
5. **Evaluate Quality**: When evaluating the quality of product names, consider factors such as uniqueness, relevance to the product, and appeal to the target audience.

6. **Divide Labor**: Suggestions on dividing the naming process among teams or individuals are included to optimize efficiency.

## Instructions

To contribute to the brainstorming of product names, follow these steps:

1. Review the prompts provided in the repository.
2. Choose a prompt that interests you.
3. Brainstorm creative and innovative product names based on the given description.
4. Ensure your suggestions adhere to the specified format.
5. Submit your contributions by creating a pull request.

## Examples

Here's a short example for each of the five rules:

# Optimized Prompt

Input:
Generate a bullet-point list of 5 male Disney characters.
Only include the name of the character for each line.
Never include the film for each Disney character.
Only return the Disney characters, never include any commentary.

Below is an example list:
* Aladdin
* Simba
* Beast
* Hercules
* Tarzan

Output:
* Woody
* Buzz Lightyear
* Stitch
* Jack Sparrow
* Prince Charming
* 
# Mock CSV Data Generation

ChatGPT can generate mock CSV data that can be utilized for testing purposes or other uses.

## Input

Generate a sample CSV data for five students with the following fields:
- name
- age
- grade

## Output

- name,age,grade
- Mohammed,16,A
- Ahmed,17,B
- Omar,16,A
- Ali,16,B
- Youssef,17,A
